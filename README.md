**gpbl-bot** is a Python-based Discord bot that plays music from a library 24/7 in a specified voice channel.<br/>

# How to Use ‚úçÔ∏è

This bot is currently hosted by me for the **Ghetto Poetry Battle League** Discord server.

***Alternatively, to host it yourself...***
1. Put your [Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) into `src/.env.sample` and rename it to `src/.env`.
2. Install pip: `sudo apt install python3-pip` (Debian/Ubuntu)
3. You will need to enable systemd service lingering for the user: `loginctl enable-linger $(whoami)`
3. Run `make install`.
